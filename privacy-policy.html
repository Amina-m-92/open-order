          <h4>Log Data</h4>

          <h4>Service Providers</h4>
          <p>
              I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

          </p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
              I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
